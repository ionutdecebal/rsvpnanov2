# RSVP Nano

RSVP Nano is an open-source ESP32-S3 reading device for showing text one word at a time with RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation). The firmware is built around stable anchor-letter rendering, readable typography, tunable pacing, SD card storage, and a web-first book conversion workflow.

## Highlights

- One-word RSVP reader with stable anchor alignment.
- Optional page-scroll reading mode that keeps the same pacing/book-position mechanics without the RSVP anchor.
- Hold to read, double-tap to lock autoplay, tap to stop locked autoplay, and pause on sentence boundaries.
- Horizontal scrub preview with hold-to-scroll text browsing, then tap to return to RSVP.
- Adjustable typeface, font size, typography, anchor guides, pacing, and phantom words.
- Menu language selection for English, Spanish, French, German, Romanian, and Polish.
- Chapter and paragraph-aware navigation.
- SD card library under `/books`.
- Web-first book conversion and SD-card library sync from the browser flasher.
- USB mass-storage mode for copying books to the SD card.
- Browser-based firmware installation plus in-browser library conversion, sidecar cleanup, and SD-card sync.

## Getting Started

### Flash From The Browser

The easiest way to install the firmware is the web flasher:

<https://ionutdecebal.github.io/rsvpnano/>

Use Chrome or Edge on desktop, connect the device over USB, and follow the installer prompts.

The browser flasher uses ESP Web Tools and Web Serial, so it must be opened over HTTPS or localhost.
It also includes a browser-side Library Workspace for importing supported books, converting them
into `.rsvp`, downloading a `.zip` of the results, cleaning interrupted sidecar files, and syncing
the converted outputs back into the SD card's `/books` folder.

On the device, you can switch the menu language in `Settings -> Display -> Language`.
You can also switch between anchored RSVP and the page scroller in `Settings -> Display ->
Reading mode`.
While paused in RSVP mode, swipe left or right to open the larger scrub preview, hold and move
your finger vertically to browse smoothly through the text, and tap to return to the anchored
word view.

The browser workflow currently accepts:

- `.epub`
- `.txt`
- `.md` / `.markdown`
- `.html` / `.htm` / `.xhtml`

The browser page automatically writes `.rsvp` output that preserves common accented, Baltic,
Sami, and other extended-Latin letters while staying compatible with the current firmware.
It is currently the best-supported conversion path and the recommended way to prepare books.

### Add Books

The easiest workflow is to use the Library Workspace on the browser flasher page, then sync the
converted files directly into the SD card's `/books` folder.

If you want to manage files manually, create a `books` folder at the root of the SD card:

```text
/books
  my-book.epub
  another-book.rsvp
```

The device library scans `/books` for `.rsvp`, `.txt`, and `.epub` files, but the recommended
workflow is to put browser-converted `.rsvp` files there whenever possible.

Current text support is best for ASCII plus a curated set of accented and extended-Latin letters
used in many European languages. That includes the usual Germanic and Nordic letters plus common
extras such as `OE`/`oe` ligatures, Polish `L`-slash style letters, Romanian comma-accent letters,
several Central European and Turkish forms, the Czech and Hungarian letters used outside Latin-1,
and the Baltic/Sami letters used in Latvian, Lithuanian, and Sami text. Common book punctuation
such as curly quotes, guillemets, and bracket variants is normalized into readable ASCII wrappers.
The Standard serif reader font renders that wider Latin set directly. In the other reader fonts
and in the tiny UI font, unsupported letters currently fall back to the closest plain ASCII letter
in the selected font instead of switching fonts.
More complex scripts still need additional renderer and font work.

The firmware prioritizes `.rsvp` files. If a matching `.rsvp` file does not exist yet, an EPUB
can still be converted locally the first time it is opened, and the converted `.rsvp` file is then
reused on future launches. That on-device path is best treated as a fallback; the browser converter
currently has the best compatibility and library-management flow.

If a conversion is interrupted, you may see sidecar files such as:

```text
.rsvp.tmp
.rsvp.converting
.rsvp.failed
```

## Build From Source

Install PlatformIO Core, then run:

```sh
pio run
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor
```

The default environment is `waveshare_esp32s3_usb_msc`, which includes the reader and USB transfer mode.

Serial monitor runs at `115200`.

To export the merged binary used by the browser flasher:

```sh
python3 tools/export_web_firmware.py
```

That command writes:

```text
web/firmware/rsvp-nano.bin
```

## Hardware

The current firmware configuration targets the [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-3.49](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-3.49.htm?&aff_id=153227). This is an affiliate link, so if you click it to find the hardware and buy the board, it helps support the project:

- ESP32-S3 with 16 MB flash and OPI PSRAM.
- AXS15231B-based 172 x 640 LCD panel used in landscape as 640 x 172.
- SD card connected through `SD_MMC`.
- Touch, battery, and board power control pins defined in `src/board/BoardConfig.h`.

If you are adapting the project to different hardware, start with `src/board/BoardConfig.h`, then review the display, touch, power, and SD wiring code.

## Running Tests

The pacing algorithm has a host-side unit test suite that runs without hardware using PlatformIO's native environment.

```sh
pio test -e native_test
```

Tests live in `test/test_pacing/` and cover word duration calculation (length tiers, syllable complexity, punctuation pauses, abbreviation detection, pacing scale), WPM clamping, and seek/scrub behaviour. A minimal `Arduino.h` shim in `test/support/` lets `ReadingLoop.cpp` compile on the host without the ESP32 SDK.

## Desktop Converter Fallback

You do not need the desktop converter for the normal workflow. The browser flasher page is the
recommended conversion path and can already convert supported books locally and sync them into the
SD card.

The desktop helper is still available if you want an offline, script-driven, or batch-conversion
fallback on a computer. To use it, copy the helper files from `tools/sd_card_converter` to the SD
card root and run the launcher for your platform:

- Windows: `Convert books.bat`
- macOS: `Convert books.command`
- Linux: `convert_books_linux.sh` or `python3 convert_books.py`

The desktop converter scans `/books` and creates `.rsvp` files beside supported sources.
The Linux path has been used during development. The macOS and Windows launchers are included, but they have not been tested yet.

Supported input formats:

- `.epub`
- `.txt`
- `.md` / `.markdown`
- `.html` / `.htm` / `.xhtml`

## RSVP File Format

`.rsvp` files are plain text. The reader understands a small set of directives:

```text
@rsvp 1
@title The Book Title
@author Author Name
@source /books/source.epub
@chapter Chapter 1
@para
```

Normal text lines after the directives are split into words by the firmware.
